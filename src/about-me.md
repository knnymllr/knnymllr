We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. A little happy sunlight shining through there.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. That easy. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.

I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Just make little strokes like that. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.

Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Let your imagination be your guide. Have fun with it. Work that paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.

This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. With practice comes confidence. You have to make those little noises or it won't work.

I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. You can do it. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. This is the fun part

We'll put a happy little bush here. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. We don't have anything but happy trees here. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.
