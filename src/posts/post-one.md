Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. All those little son of a guns. Here we're limited by the time we have. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. You can create anything that makes you happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.

Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We'll do another happy little painting. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Just make little strokes like that.

Let's do that again. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.

These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Little short strokes. That easy. Poor old tree. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.

You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Every time you practice, you learn more. What the devil. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.

And maybe a little bush lives there. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. All kinds of happy little splashes.

Just use the old one inch brush. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Here's another little happy bush Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.

We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. A fan brush can be your best friend. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.
