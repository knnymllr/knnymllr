Thanks to Bob Ross Lipsum I can generate oodles of filler content with a can-do attitude that speaks directly to my creative spirit and sense of self-worth.  Here's a sample:

> *If what you're doing doesn't make you happy—you're doing the wrong thing. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Don't fight it, use what happens. Every single thing in the world has its own personality—and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.*

Admittedly, I have not spent much time thinking about Lorem Ipsum in great detail prior to writing this, though upon further consideration perhaps that's the point. Imagine you have contracted a website design for a food blog and received draft pages filled with **Content goes here, Content goes there**. Although true, reading the same few words repeating creates a distracting, predictable pattern for the brain to latch onto, and does not provide a realistic expectation of how text will render to the page. Wouldn't it be more valuable for you to evaluate the proposed design with filler text that resembles final copy?

The proposed utility of Lorem Ipsum is simple—when a client is in the process of curating content it is still possible to deliver a prototype with varied word length and sentence structure. While indulging my curiosity on the subject, I came across a 2017 blog post where the author, Chaymae Lougmani, asks two questions in succession that caused me to reflect on my experience with Lorem Ipsum, and helped me realize my affinity for an amusing Lipsum generator is not rooted in nostalgia alone. 

> *How can you design for something you don’t even understand? How can insignificant content contribute to creating a customised experience?*

<<<<<<< HEAD
Though Lorem Ipsum serves its purpose as unassuming placeholder text, it may hinder how a client and designer visualize the transformation to final copy. I struggle to retain concepts in documentation that rely soley on terms like `foo` and `bar` for the same reason. Until it was pointed out to me, I believed those terms to be concepts I hadn't learned about yet, thus avoiding crucial sections of documentation in the process. 

When you are in-charge of the technical framework that supports another person's creative process it can be easy to take for granted the experience you provide. If you are engineering an album, you can't expect a band to envision the final product without a realistic understanding of what the tools you work with are capable of. While Lorem Ipsum won't make or break your project, you can show a collaborator that you are invested by filling a design draft with content that matches the scope of the project or inspires them to see their vision through to the end.

Incorporating Bob Ross Lipsum into my workflow keeps the collaboration process positive at the beginning stages of a project. Imagine you have received the same draft pages from before, but with copy in your language. Perhaps instead of Bob Ross Lipsum, the designer has included sample recipes and text from reference sites you provided. Which draft would you prefer to receive?

This post is not affiliated with Bob Ross Lipsum in any way, it just brings me great joy. Can't stand Bob Ross? (How dare you!) Check out the ultimate list of Lipsum generators below and find one that suits your style. Alternatively, it could be a fun project to take on in your spare time—I aspire to one day create a Mitch Hedberg Lipsum Generator.
