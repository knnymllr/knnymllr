My name is Kenny Miller.  I'm a web developer living in Philadelphia.  After 10+ years working in restaurants, event planning, and mental health I decided to learn how to build websites.  I will use this environment to document my progress from beginner all the way to professional beginner.  

## Goals v 1.1.2

- Further utilize templating languages in Eleventy and implement pagination
- Successfully integrate a website with a CMS
- Begin Vue School courses and improve understanding of object-oriented programming
- ~~Stare at old code in disbelief and shake head furiously~~
- ~~Unlock super secret Github repo~~
- ~~Familiarize myself with ES6~~
- ~~Build my first website~~

## Install

Run `npm install` in project root directory to install all project dependencies.  This website was built with Eleventy, Webpack, and Sass.

## Build and Serve

Run `npm run serve` in project root directory to clear output directory, build website and serve to [https://localhost:8080/](https://localhost:8080/).  View all scripts in `package.json`.
